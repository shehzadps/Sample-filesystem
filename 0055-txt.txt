Based on the previously agreed forward plan and on the issues arising, the following forward plan is proposed:

Appendix 2

A central programme budget has been introduced for the first time for 2013-14. Departments have been asked to bid for funds. The pot totals £2.4m.

The latest position on the central programme budget for 2013-14 is shown in Table 1 immediately below. Table 2 lists each programme which has received approval in principle.

Within the first 6 weeks of the year, three quarters of the Central programme budget have now been approved or are earmarked for approval therefore continued careful consideration needs to be taken to ensure that availability remains for needs which may only become apparent later in the year.
